injectpy
========

A package featuring dependency injection and a service container (also known as an **IoC container**, where IoC stands for *Inversion of Control*) for Python. An experiment in progress. Details will be filled in soon.

The main inspiration for this project was `pinject`_, a dependency injection library developed by Google but no longer maintained and with no support for Python 3.  Ideas were borrowed also from other dependency injection libraries such as `Dagger`_.

The name was not very well thought of. Other combinations of “Python” and “injection” were already taken…
